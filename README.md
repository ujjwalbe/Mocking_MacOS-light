   ```
   /home/$USER/.local/share/icons
   ```

   Color scheme used for the system is McMojave-Light-Modified i customized it according to my test, you can also do it by clicking the pen icon on color scheme.
   For Konosole i customized it totaly as my test it also can be found in this repo i call it TimeStone.
## Theme Engine
   Theme engine used here is called [Kvantum](https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum/tree/master/Kvantum) Engine all of its themes can be found in here.
   First you need to install it from this [Link](https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum/tree/master/Kvantum). 
   After installation select the theme downloaded from [here](https://github.com/ujjwalbe/Mocking_MacOS-light/tree/master/Kvantum) by opening Kvantum and Select Install theme.
   Then go to system setting > Application Style> Kvantum
   Then go to Kvantum select the installed theme that is McMojave-light. You may need to logout or refresh plasma shell to
   see the result.
## Terminal Shell
   Using Zsh shel instead of bash.
   
   Oh My Zsh will not make you a 10x developer...but you may feel like one.
   For customizing terminal. Use a Powerline font for proper result.All the instructions can be found in Oh My Zsh repo.
